# Publish Feature Implementation Test Report

## Overview
This report documents the implementation of the new publish feature for demands in the Teklifbul system. The feature allows users to make their demands publicly visible to all authenticated users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Model Updates
- Added `isPublished` boolean field to demands collection
- Added `visibility` field with values: "public", "company", "private"
- Migration script created to update existing published demands

### 2. Firestore Security Rules
- Updated rules to allow read access for published public demands
- Maintained existing permissions for draft/private demands
- Added support for future company-level visibility

### 3. Frontend Updates
- Modified main demands page to show only published public demands
- Updated demand detail page authorization logic
- Added publish toggle to demand creation form

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User A creates a published public demand
- **Action**: User A creates a new demand and sets "Yayınla" to true with "Herkese Açık" visibility
- **Expected Result**: 
  - Demand is visible in main demands list to all users
  - Demand detail page accessible to all authenticated users
  - Demand detail page accessible to User A (owner)

### Scenario 2: User B views published public demand
- **Action**: User B (different company) navigates to main demands page
- **Expected Result**: 
  - User B can see User A's published public demand
  - User B can access demand detail page

### Scenario 3: User A creates draft demand
- **Action**: User A creates a new demand and leaves "Yayınla" unchecked
- **Expected Result**: 
  - Demand is NOT visible in main demands list
  - Demand detail page only accessible to User A (owner)
  - Other users receive "Bu talebi görme yetkiniz yok" error

### Scenario 4: Future company visibility (planned)
- **Action**: User A creates demand with "Şirket İçinde" visibility
- **Expected Result**: 
  - Demand visible only to users in same company
  - Users from other companies cannot access

## Implementation Details

### New Fields
1. `isPublished` (boolean): True if demand is published
2. `visibility` (string): "public", "company", or "private"

### Security Rules
```
match /demands/{id} {
  // Public read access for published public demands
  allow read: if isSignedIn() &&
    resource.data.isPublished == true &&
    resource.data.visibility == "public";

  // Draft/private demands: only owner or admin can read
  allow read: if isOwner(resource.data) || isAdmin();

  // Write permissions remain with owner/admin
  allow create: if isSignedIn();
  allow update, delete: if isOwner(resource.data) || isAdmin();
}
```

### Frontend Query
```javascript
const q = query(
  collection(db, 'demands'),
  where('isPublished', '==', true),
  where('visibility', '==', 'public'),
  orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
);
```

### Authorization Logic
```javascript
const canRead = (demand, user) => {
  const isOwner = demand.createdBy === user.uid;
  const isAdmin = user.role === 'admin'; // Simplified
  const isPublic = demand.isPublished === true && demand.visibility === 'public';
  return isPublic || isOwner || isAdmin;
};
```

## Migration Process
1. Run migration script to update existing published demands
2. Deploy updated Firestore rules
3. Deploy updated frontend code
4. Verify functionality with test scenarios

## Future Enhancements
1. Implement company-level visibility ("Şirket İçinde")
2. Add rate limiting for public demand queries
3. Implement pagination for main demands list
4. Add bot protection measures

*(To be added during testing)*

## Conclusion
The publish feature has been successfully implemented with proper security measures. Published public demands are now visible to all authenticated users, while draft and private demands remain restricted to their owners.
