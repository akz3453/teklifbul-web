## 🔑 Key Changes

### Data Model (users/{uid})

**New Fields:**
- `roles: string[]` - Array of roles (replaces `role`)
- `isPremium: boolean` - Premium account flag
- `supplierCategories: string[]` - Categories for receiving demands
- `buyerCategories: string[]` - Categories for organizing demands

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Old `role` field automatically converts to `roles` array
- Old `categories` field maps to `supplierCategories`

### UI Changes (settings.html)

**Updated:**
- Role selection: Radio buttons → Checkboxes
- Categories: Single section → Two sections (buyer/supplier)
- Tax certificate: Added "Remove" button

**New:**
- Premium account toggle
- Conditional visibility for category sections
- Tax certificate deletion workflow

### Publishing Logic (demand-detail.html)

**Enhanced:**
- Queries suppliers with matching categories
- Uses `array-contains-any` for efficient matching
- Populates `viewerIds` with relevant suppliers only
- Shows supplier count after publishing

### Security (firestore.rules, storage.rules)

**Improved:**
- Null-safe checks for `viewerIds`
- Support for both `role` and `roles` fields
- Delete permissions for tax certificates
- Stricter access control

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Deployment
1. ✅ Backup current Firestore and Storage rules
2. ✅ Review all code changes
3. ✅ Run automated tests
4. ✅ Complete manual testing
5. ✅ Prepare rollback plan

### After Deployment
1. Deploy rules first
2. Create required indexes (when prompted)
3. Test in production with test account
4. Monitor error logs for 24 hours
5. Update documentation if needed

### Known Limitations
- `array-contains-any` supports max 10 categories per query
- First query may fail until index is created
- Real-time updates require manual refresh

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

```bash
# 1. Restore previous rules (immediate)
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules

# 2. Code changes are backward compatible
# No rollback needed for HTML files

# 3. Data migration is automatic
# Old format continues to work
```
