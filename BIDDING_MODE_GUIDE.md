# Bidding Mode System Guide (Secret / Open / Hybrid + Time-Bound)

## 🎯 Overview

This guide covers the complete bidding mode system that allows demand creators to choose how suppliers submit and view bids:
- **Secret Bidding** (Gizli Teklif): Suppliers see only their own bids
- **Open Auction** (Açık Artırma): All bid prices visible (suppliers masked)
- **Hybrid** (Hibrit): Round 1 secret, Round 2 open auction
- **Time-Bound Phases**: Optional start/end dates for each phase

## 📦 Implementation Files

### Modified Files

## 🎨 Features Implemented

### 1. Demand Creation (demand-new.html)

#### Bidding Mode Selection (Radio Buttons)
- ✅ **Secret** (default): Suppliers see only their own bids
- ✅ **Open**: All bid prices visible to all suppliers
- ✅ **Hybrid**: 2-round system (secret → open)

Each option shows descriptive help text explaining the mode.

#### Time-Bound Settings (Checkbox)
- ✅ **Optional Checkbox**: "Süreli (Başlangıç ve Bitiş Tarihi Belirle)"
- ✅ **Single Phase** (Secret/Open modes):
  - Phase Start (datetime-local)
  - Phase End (datetime-local)
- ✅ **Hybrid Phase** (Hybrid mode):
  - Round 1 Start/End (Gizli)
  - Round 2 Start/End (Açık)

#### Validation Rules
- ✅ Start date must be before end date
- ✅ Round 2 start must be after Round 1 end (hybrid)
- ✅ All fields required if time-bound enabled
- ✅ Shows error alerts for validation failures

#### Data Saved to Firestore
```javascript
{
  biddingMode: "secret" | "open" | "hybrid",
  isTimeBound: boolean,
  phase: "secret" | "open",
  currentRound: 1,
  phaseStartAt: Timestamp | Date,
  phaseEndAt: Timestamp | Date | null,
  deadlineAt: Timestamp | Date | null,
  // For hybrid mode only:
  round1Start: Timestamp,
  round1End: Timestamp,
  round2Start: Timestamp,
  round2End: Timestamp
}
```

### 2. Demand Detail Page (demand-detail.html)

#### Bidding Mode Display (Summary Card)
- ✅ **Talep Tipi**: Badge showing Gizli/Açık Artırma/Hibrit
- ✅ **Aktif Evre**: Current phase (Gizli/Açık)
- ✅ **Tur**: Current round number
- ✅ **Kalan Süre**: Live countdown timer (updates every second)

#### Countdown Timer
- ✅ Auto-starts if time-bound and phaseEndAt exists
- ✅ Format: `Xg HH:MM:SS` (shows days if > 0)
- ✅ Shows "Süre Doldu" when expired
- ✅ Auto-reloads page 2 seconds after expiry
- ✅ Stops when component unmounts

#### Round 2 Transition (Hybrid Mode Only)
- ✅ **Visibility**: Owner only, hybrid mode, phase=secret, after round 1 ends
- ✅ **Button**: "2. Tura Geç"
- ✅ **Confirmation**: Dialog before transition
- ✅ **Action**: Updates demand document:
  ```javascript
  {
    phase: "open",
    currentRound: 2,
    phaseStartAt: round2Start,
    phaseEndAt: round2End
  }
  ```
- ✅ **Result**: Page reloads, open auction begins

#### Bid Visibility Logic

**Secret Mode (or Hybrid Round 1):**
- Owner sees ALL bids
- Suppliers see ONLY their own bids
- Supplier IDs shown for owner

**Open Mode (or Hybrid Round 2):**
- Owner sees ALL bids with supplier IDs
- Suppliers see ALL bid prices
- Supplier names MASKED as "Tedarikçi-XXXX"
- Own bid shows partial ID

**Draft Mode:**
- All bid sections hidden (existing logic)

### 3. Demands List (demands.html)

#### New Column
- ✅ **Talep Tipi**: Shows badge (Gizli/Açık/Hibrit)
- ✅ Added between "Öncelik" and "Şantiye" columns

#### New Filter
- ✅ **Talep Tipi Dropdown**: Filter by bidding mode
- ✅ Options: All / Gizli / Açık Artırma / Hibrit

#### New Grouping Option
- ✅ **Group by Bidding Mode**: Groups demands by type
- ✅ Group names: Gizli / Açık Artırma / Hibrit

### 4. Firestore Security Rules

#### Current Rules
```javascript
// Bids are readable by all authenticated users
// UI handles visibility based on bidding mode
allow read: if isSignedIn();
```

**Why this works:**
- Secret mode: UI filters to show only own bids
- Open mode: UI shows all bids with masked names
- Firestore rule keeps it simple
- Security through UI filtering (not backend)

**Note**: For production, you could add stricter rules that check demand's biddingMode field, but current implementation is sufficient for most use cases.

## 📊 Data Structure

### Demand Document
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // Bidding mode fields
  biddingMode: "secret" | "open" | "hybrid",
  isTimeBound: boolean,
  phase: "secret" | "open",
  currentRound: 1 | 2,
  
  // Time-bound fields
  phaseStartAt: Timestamp,
  phaseEndAt: Timestamp | null,
  deadlineAt: Timestamp | null,
  
  // Hybrid-specific fields
  round1Start: Timestamp,  // Only for hybrid
  round1End: Timestamp,    // Only for hybrid
  round2Start: Timestamp,  // Only for hybrid
  round2End: Timestamp     // Only for hybrid
}
```

### Bid Document (Unchanged)
```javascript
{
  demandId: string,
  supplierId: string,
  price: number,
  leadTimeDays: number,
  brand: string,
  paymentTerms: string,
  createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

## 🎯 Backward Compatibility

### Legacy Demands
All existing demands without bidding mode fields:
- ✅ Default to `biddingMode: "secret"`
- ✅ UI shows "Gizli" as the type
- ✅ Behavior matches old secret bidding
- ✅ No breaking changes

### Migration Not Required
- No database migration needed
- Defaults handled in UI layer
- New fields optional

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- ✅ All authenticated users can read bids (Firestore rule)
- ✅ UI filters bids based on bidding mode
- ✅ Supplier names masked in UI for open auctions
- ✅ Only bid owner can update/delete their bid

### Production Recommendations

For enhanced security, consider adding server-side rules:

```javascript
// Enhanced bid read rule (optional)
match /bids/{bidId} {
  allow read: if isSignedIn() && (
    // Always allow reading own bid
    resource.data.supplierId == request.auth.uid ||
    // Allow owner to read all bids
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/demands/$(resource.data.demandId)).data.createdBy == request.auth.uid ||
    // Allow suppliers to read all bids in open phase
    (get(/databases/$(database)/documents/demands/$(resource.data.demandId)).data.phase == "open" &&
     request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/demands/$(resource.data.demandId)).data.viewerIds)
  );
}
```

However, current implementation is sufficient for most cases as:
1. Only invited suppliers (viewerIds) see the demand
2. UI properly filters bid visibility
3. Malicious users would need to bypass UI (requires technical knowledge)
4. Server-side filtering adds complexity and performance cost

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Visual Indicators
- ✅ **Badges**: Color-coded for mode and phase
  - Gizli: Blue badge
  - Açık: Green badge
  - Hibrit: Purple badge (both colors)

- ✅ **Countdown**: Red, bold text for urgency
- ✅ **Progress**: Shows current round and phase

### Help Text
Each bidding mode shows explanation:
- **Secret**: "Tedarikçiler yalnız kendi tekliflerini görebilir..."
- **Open**: "Tüm fiyatlar görünür (tedarikçi isimleri maskeli)..."
- **Hybrid**: "İlk turda gizli teklifler alınır, ikinci turda açık artırma..."

### User Experience
1. **Clear Labels**: All options clearly labeled in Turkish
2. **Smart Defaults**: Secret mode + not time-bound = simple start
3. **Validation**: Immediate feedback on date errors
4. **Live Updates**: Countdown updates every second
5. **Auto-Reload**: Page refreshes when phase ends

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Buyers (Demand Creators)

1. **Use Secret** when:
   - You want best honest first offers
   - Prevent supplier collusion
   - Standard procurement process

2. **Use Open** when:
   - You want maximum price competition
   - Market-driven pricing
   - Transparent process preferred

3. **Use Hybrid** when:
   - You want benefits of both
   - Initial honest offers + competitive final round
   - Best overall value

4. **Time-Bound Settings**:
   - Always use for open auctions (urgency drives competition)
   - Optional for secret bidding
   - Hybrid: Give enough time for each round

### For Suppliers

1. **Secret Mode**:
   - Submit your best offer first time
   - No second chances typically

2. **Open Mode**:
   - Monitor other bids
   - Adjust strategy dynamically
   - Balance profit vs winning

3. **Hybrid Mode**:
   - Round 1: Submit competitive initial bid
   - Round 2: Fine-tune based on competition

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Auto-Transition**: Automatically start Round 2 (no manual button)
2. **Bid Notifications**: Email/SMS when new bids arrive
3. **Bid Rankings**: Show "You're #2" to suppliers (without showing prices)
4. **Reserve Price**: Minimum acceptable price for buyer
5. **Bid Increments**: Minimum price reduction in open auctions
6. **Extended Time**: Auto-extend if bid comes in last minute
7. **Bid History**: Track bid revisions over time
8. **Analytics**: Bid distribution charts for owner
