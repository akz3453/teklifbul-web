# üöÄ Teklifbul - Deployment Instructions

## üìã Summary

This project has several fixes that are ready to be deployed. The main issue is that the updated Firestore rules haven't been deployed yet, which is causing permission errors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixes Ready to Deploy

1. **Company Document Creation Fix** - Fixed issues with company data loading
2. **Companies Collection Rules** - Added proper Firestore rules for companies
3. **Dashboard Improvements** - Better error handling and company creation
4. **Demand Pages Fixes** - Fixed company loading in demand-detail.html and demand-new.html
5. **Favicon Fixes** - Added favicons to all pages
6. **FX API Fix** - Fixed broken currency exchange rate API
7. **CSP Security Fixes** - Fixed Content Security Policy violations

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Manual Deployment (Recommended)
Follow the instructions in [`MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`](MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)

This is the most reliable option since automated deployment tools aren't working.

### Option 2: Automated Deployment (If you can fix the environment)
Try running [`deploy-rules-auto.bat`](deploy-rules-auto.bat) after fixing:
1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Fix PowerShell execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
