# Publish Feature Implementation Summary

## Objective
Make published demands visible to all authenticated users while keeping drafts and private demands restricted to their owners.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Data Model Updates
- **File**: [migrate-demands.js](file:///C:/Users/faruk/OneDrive/Desktop/teklifbul-web/migrate-demands.js)

  - Added `isPublished` boolean field to demands
  - Added `visibility` field with values: "public", "company", "private"
  - Migration script to update existing published demands

### 2. Firestore Security Rules
- **File**: [firestore.rules](file:///C:/Users/faruk/OneDrive/Desktop/teklifbul-web/firestore.rules)
- **Changes**:
  - New read rule: `isPublished == true && visibility == "public"` allows all authenticated users to read
  - Draft/private demands: Only owners or admins can read
  - Write permissions remain unchanged (owner/admin only)

### 3. Main Demands Page
- **File**: [main-demands.html](file:///C:/Users/faruk/OneDrive/Desktop/teklifbul-web/main-demands.html)
- **Changes**:
  - Updated query to fetch only `isPublished == true && visibility == "public"` demands
  - Added `orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')` for proper sorting
  - Simplified filtering logic

### 4. Demand Detail Page
- **File**: [demand-detail.html](file:///C:/Users/faruk/OneDrive/Desktop/teklifbul-web/demand-detail.html)
- **Changes**:
  - Updated authorization logic with `canRead` function
  - Only shows "Bu talebi görme yetkiniz yok" for truly unauthorized access
  - Public published demands accessible to all authenticated users

### 5. Demand Creation Page
- **File**: [demand-new.html](file:///C:/Users/faruk/OneDrive/Desktop/teklifbul-web/demand-new.html)

## Key Features

### Public Visibility

### Privacy Protection
- Draft demands remain invisible to others
- Private demands only visible to owner and invited users
- Backward compatibility maintained

### Future Extensibility
- Company-level visibility ready for implementation
- Admin override capabilities
- Flexible visibility model

## Security Model

## Deployment Steps

1. Deploy updated Firestore rules
2. Run migration script to update existing demands
3. Deploy updated frontend files
4. Test with provided scenarios
5. Monitor for any permission issues

## Testing Required

1. Create published public demand - verify visibility
2. Create draft demand - verify privacy
3. Access public demand as different user - verify access
4. Access draft demand as different user - verify denial
5. Update existing demand - verify field persistence

## Future Considerations

1. Implement company-level visibility
2. Add pagination to main demands list
3. Implement rate limiting for public queries
4. Add bot protection measures
5. Implement search and filtering for public demands
