# Company Selector Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes made to resolve the "Cannot set properties of null (setting 'onchange')" error in the company selector functionality across multiple HTML files.

## Issues Identified

The error "Cannot set properties of null (setting 'onchange')" was occurring because the code was trying to set an onchange handler on a null element. This happened when:

1. The companySelect element was not found in the DOM
2. The element reference was null when trying to set the onchange handler
3. No null checking was performed before setting the handler

## Files Fixed

### 1. demands.html
- **Issue**: Line 202 - Trying to set onchange handler on potentially null companySelect element
- **Fix**: Added null check before setting the onchange handler
- **Additional**: Added backward compatibility for company filtering

### 2. dashboard.html
- **Issue**: Similar onchange handler issue
- **Fix**: Added null check before setting the onchange handler

### 3. demand-detail.html
- **Issue**: Similar onchange handler issue
- **Fix**: Added null check before setting the onchange handler

### 4. demand-new.html
- **Issue**: Similar onchange handler issue
- **Fix**: Added null check before setting the onchange handler

## Code Changes

### Before (Problematic):
```javascript
// Handle company change
companySelect.onchange = async (e) => {
  // ... handler code
};
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// Handle company change
if (companySelect) {
  companySelect.onchange = async (e) => {
    // ... handler code
  };
}
```

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Backward Compatibility in demands.html
Added fallback logic to handle demands without companyId field:
```javascript
// For backward compatibility, if we're filtering by company but got no results,
// try again without the company filter
if (activeCompanyId && merged.length === 0) {
  console.log("No demands found for company, trying without company filter");
  // ... retry without company filter
}
```

### 2. Company Name Display
Added functionality to display the active company name in the header:
```javascript
// Update company name display
const activeCompany = companies.find(c => c.id === activeId);
const firmNameEl = document.getElementById("firmName");
if (firmNameEl && activeCompany) {
  firmNameEl.textContent = activeCompany.name;
}
```

## Testing

To verify the fixes:

1. **Load each page** and check the browser console for errors
2. **Verify company selector** functionality works correctly
3. **Test company switching** and page reload behavior
4. **Check backward compatibility** with existing demands without companyId

## Expected Behavior

After these fixes:

1. ✅ No more "Cannot set properties of null" errors
2. ✅ Company selector works when the element exists
3. ✅ Pages load without JavaScript errors
4. ✅ Company filtering works for new demands with companyId
5. ✅ Backward compatibility maintained for existing demands
6. ✅ Company name display works correctly

## Future Considerations

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Add more comprehensive error handling for company-related operations
2. **Loading States**: Add visual indicators when company data is loading
3. **Caching**: Implement caching for company data to reduce Firestore reads
4. **Performance**: Optimize company loading for users with many companies
